here is the overview of the shells:
In Linux, a shell is a program that provides an interface between the user and the operating system. It interprets commands entered by the user and executes them. There are several types of shells; the three commonly used ones are:

1)Bourne Shell (sh)

One of the earliest and most basic shells in Linux.

Used for writing simple scripts and executing basic commands.

Syntax is straightforward and widely supported.

2)Bourne Again Shell (Bash)

Most commonly used shell in Linux today.

Combines features of Bourne Shell and other shells like Korn Shell.

Supports command history, tab completion, and scripting features.

Ideal for both interactive use and writing complex shell scripts.

3)C Shell (csh)

Syntax is similar to the C programming language.

Provides features like aliasing, job control, and history mechanism.

Preferred by users familiar with C-style syntax and for certain types of scripts.
