In Linux, a shell is a program that provides an interface between the user and the operating system. It interprets commands entered by the user and executes them. There are several types of shells; the three commonly used ones are:

Backup Shell Script:
This script is used to create a backup of a folder by copying it into another directory. It also adds a timestamp so that each backup is stored separately and safely.

CPU & Memory Monitoring Shell Script:
This script continuously checks the system’s CPU and memory usage and saves the data in a log file. It helps in monitoring system performance.

Automated Download Shell Script:
This script automatically downloads a file from a given URL and saves it into a specific folder. It helps in automating file downloading tasks using commands like wget or curl.
